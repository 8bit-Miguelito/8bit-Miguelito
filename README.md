## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Skills: C, C++, Python, Data Structures.

- I'm currently working on a few school and personal projects to challenge myself as a programmer.

- I'm currently learning data structures, memory allocation, and C.

- I'm looking to collaborate on projects that put an emphasis on data structures.

My favorite passion project at the moment is an Elden Ring build builder program. It would allow players to build a character based on their preferences.
