## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Miguel 

Skills: C, C++, Python | Data Structures | Memory Management | Valgrind, GDB

I'm a programmer constantly challenging myself with school and personal projects. I'm currently
diving deep into data structures, memory allocation, and C, honing my ability to write 
optimized and efficient code. 

## ðŸ¤–What I'm Working On
- Developing an Elden Ring Build Builder, allowing players to craft their character build based on their preferences.
- Tackling data structure-heavy projects that will refine my problem-solving abilities.
- Working on Food Web Project for school that tackles memory allocation and management to refine my debugging skills.

## ðŸ‘¾Collaborate

I'm excited to work on team-based projects that could challenge my problem-solving skills. Anything from 
game-related projects to performance optimization or even just fun coding challenges.
